# fvc-manifest
DCT FirstView fvc-manifest project



======================================================================================================================
#The following comments were added by Swathi while mirroring the DCT GitHub repositories to the FirstView repositories:

1.The manifest (.xml) file was initially created for the Celeritas SOM (standalone board without a carrier board), with the source code available in the "meta-fvc" repository of the DCT GitHub (kept unchanged in the FirstView GitHub).

2.The file was later updated to support the Agility SOM (Standalone + Carrier board).

3.Software driver support for Carrier board interfaces is maintained in a new meta layer/repository called "meta-agility-demo" in the DCT GitHub (renamed to "meta-agility" in the FirstView GitHub). For standalone board peripherals, software driver support continues to reside in the "meta-fvc" repository.
